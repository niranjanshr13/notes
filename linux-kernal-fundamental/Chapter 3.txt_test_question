In this series of challenges, we create a loadable module, experiment with the use of loadable modules, and create and use parameters for modules.
You need to be root.
You need to have installed a Linux kernel development package. On CentOS/Red Hat systems, that is normally kernel-devel. There should be a link to the kernel directory with a Makefile, including
subdirectory etc., called /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build. If the build does not exist or is a broken link, then you don’t have everything you need installed.
We are working with Linux kernel code. Bad things can happen. It is best to do this with a virtual machine
that is OK if it becomes corrupted.
1. Create a loadable module. Make an empty directory to work in.
• Create a file called lab.c. Add preprocessor commands to include theses two header files: linux/module.h and linux/sched.h.
• Add a function called my_init_module(). This should take no arguments and return an int. This function should use printk() to print a message. my_init_module() should return 0. Register the function with module_init().
• Create a function called my_cleanup_module() that takes no arguments and has no return value. It should print a message with printk(). Register the function with module_exit().
• Create a Makefile for making lab.ko.
• Compile your module to a .ko file by using make.
• Load your module with insmod. What output did you see? You may need to use the dmesg command or look in /var/log/messages.
• Run lsmod. Do you see your module?
• Use rmmod to unload your module. What message did you see?
• Run lsmod again. Do you still see your module?
• Experiment with the return code of init_module().
• Edit your module and change the return value of init_module() from 0 to -1.
• Compile the module, and try to reload it with insmod. What error did you get?
• Does your module show up in the output of lsmod?
• What happens if you try to unload the module with rmmod?
• Did my_cleanup_module() ever get called?

2. Experiment with embedded documentation.
• Modify your module to include the module author and module description.
• Recompile your module. Run modinfo with the -d and -a options against your module.












3. Add some modifiable parameters.
• Edit your module. Add both a static int called number and a static char* called word.
Initialize number to some integer. Initialize word to some string.
• Use the module_param() macro to flag number as an integer and word as a string.
• Edit the module and use the MODULE_PARM_DESC() to give descriptions for both number and word.
• Recompile your module. Run modinfo -p against the module.
• Edit the init_module() function. Have it print out the values of number and word with printk().
• Recompile and load your module. Unload and reload the module while passing new values of number and word as arguments to insmod.
